## Workshop on GLMM and GAM trees by Marjolein Fokkema

This folder contains all materials for the workshop. All data files have the extension .rda. 

There were three topics covered in the workshop: 

  * Part I: Trees and mixed-effects model trees.

  * Part II: Subgroup detection in longitudinal data: Partitioning linear and parametric spline models.

  * Part III: Subgroup detection in smoothing splines: Partitioning semi-parametric spline models.

There are two folders on this repository, containing all relevant files, with self-explanatory names:

  * Presentation slides

  * Code, instructions and data


Before running the R analyses, make sure to update to or install the latest versions of R from https://cran.r-project.org/.
